Congratulations on making it to the eleventh and final week! This week, we will walk you through a complex, end-to-end application of machine learning, to the application of Photo OCR. Identifying and recognizing objects, words, and digits in an image is a challenging task. We discuss how a pipeline can be built to tackle this problem and how to analyze and improve the performance of such a system.

*** Problem Description and Pipeline
[2016-10-04 Tue 13:43]
ML pipeline example. Focus is on how to recognize/read text in pictures. Need to detect regions with text, then read/transcribe the text in the regions. Steps in the pipeline:
1. Text detection
2. Character segmentation
3. Character classification
